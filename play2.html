            My master, your son, gave me orders to wait for him.

            Go and wait for him in the street, then; out with you; don't stay
            in my house, straight and stiff as a sentry, to observe what is going
            on, and to make your profit of everything. I won't always have before
            me a spy on all my affairs; a treacherous scamp, whose cursed eyes
            watch all my actions, covet all I possess, and ferret about in every
            corner to see if there is anything to steal.

            How the deuce could one steal anything from you? Are you a man
            likely to be robbed when you put every possible thing under lock and
            key, and mount guard day and night?
