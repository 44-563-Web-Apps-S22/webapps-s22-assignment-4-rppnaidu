<h4>ACT I:SCENE II Cleante,Dorine
    </h4>
<p>
    <h6>Cleante</h6>
    <p>I'm sure there'd only be more quarrelling.
        How that old harridan . . .</p>
    <h6>Dorine</h6>
    <p> That she can't hear you use that epithet.
        She'd tell you at length what she thinks of your wit,
        And that she's not old enough to merit it.</p>
    <h6>Cleante</h6>
    <p>What a fuss she made about nearly nothing!
        And what a passion for Tartuffe, her darling!</p>
    <h6>Dorine</h6>
    <p> Oh!  Really, she's normal compared to her son,
        And if you could see him, you'd say, "Here's one
        Who's nuts!"  During the war, he seemed quite sage,
        And in serving his prince, showed some courage,
        But now he's become an absolute fool</p>
    <h6>Cleante</h6>
    <p>Then I'll remain with no pleasure on my part
        To tell him hello and then quickly depart.</p>
    <H6>Dorine</H6>
    <p> The first day your wife had a bad fever
        And a headache that just wouldn't leave her.</p>
    <h6>Cleante</h6>
    <p>Okay. Say I don't know him if you prefer,
        But then to know what sort of man he might be . . .</p>
